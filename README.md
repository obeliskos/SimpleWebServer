# SimpleWebServer

This project is just packaging up a gist published here :
https://gist.github.com/aksakalli/9191056

So that it can be run on Windows RT 8.1 devices.

While it can be used to serve up simple web sites, I have also modified it to correctly return the mime types needed for serving up a TridentSandbox web site with proper application cache, local storage and indexeddb.
